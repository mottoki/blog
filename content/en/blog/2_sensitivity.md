Tornado chart is effective method to visualise the impact of uncertainties.

Inputs for tornado chart are simple.

![input](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/gds-website/sensitivity/sensitivity_input.png)

### 1. Base case value

Base case value is most likely scenario for the assessment.

### 2. Bound selection and order of chart

#### Bound Selection
![bound](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/gds-website/sensitivity/sensitivity_bound_selection.png)

Users can select following for bound display:

1. Show both lower bound and upper bound
2. Show only lower bound values
3. Show only upper bound values

#### Order of chart

![order](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/gds-website/sensitivity/chart_reorder.png)

Chart order can be reorganised from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest based on lower bound or upper bound values.

### 3. Sensitivity inputs

Users can select number of inputs, and enter lower bound and/or upper bound values for each inputs.

The outcome will be displayed as the tornado chart.
