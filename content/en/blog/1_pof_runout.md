Often Geotechnical Engineer use televiewer data to calculate probability of failure (POF) and runout distance from the potential failure.

### Inputs

#### Televiewer data

The application uses dip and dip direction of structure datasets. It can also utilise the spatial data for filtering purpose.

An example of input data sheet can be as the image below:

#### Slope configurations and material parameters

Slope configurations and material parameters such as shear strengths of structure are critical information for the estimation of POF and runout distance.

Open pit slope configurations such as batter face angle, berm width and batter height are required. 

Material shear strengths can be entered in Mohr-Coulomb or Barton Bandis format.

### Outcome

Based on Slope configurations and bedding shear stength, instantly able to visualise estimated POF and runout distance distribution.

#### PoF

Probability of Failure (POF) vs Batter Face Angle (BFA) graph makes it easy to visualise the optimal BFA that achieves Design Acceptance Criteria.

PoF can be filtered by spatial data including the elevation. 

Graph below shows how the application visualise PoF changes based on the elevation of slope.

#### Runout

Runout distribution is estimated using simple trigonometric calculation. Angle of repose and Swell factor can be input for the runout estimation
