Hydrogeology often greatly impact geotechnical engineering and the visualisation of relationship between water level and extraction rate can benefit engineers to comprehend the hydrogeology characteristics.

### Input data

![inputs](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/gds-website/hydrovis/inputs_hydro.png)

Input data are separately uploaded. Holes can be filtered.

Data can also be filtered by dates.

The data can be presented as the original data points or can be averaged over months.

Trendline can be added with control over level of smoothing.

### Output

Output makes it easy to see the influence of extraction volume to the waterlevel in monitoring bores.
